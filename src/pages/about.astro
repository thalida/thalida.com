        <h2>Hey, I'm Thalida!</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a queer (pronouns they/she) first generation Trinidadian-American Engineer based in New York.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over 14 years ago for my 16th birthday I wanted one thing: a domain of my own. I was lucky enough to have a supportive mother who gifted me thalida.com, and over the years this site has been the place where I learn, grow, and experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use this space to practice and learn, break things and experiment, grow and challenge myself in ways that have fewer consequences than messing around on a domain someone else owns. Here I am able to push myself as an engineer, designer, and writer. Which is all to say: if it’s ever broken, janky, or weird, I’m probably in the process of learning something new, and you’re coming along for the ride with me! ✨
