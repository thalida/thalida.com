## Django Generic Fields

Django's generic fields allow you to create flexible data models that can store various types of data without needing to define a specific field type for each piece of data. This is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic data structures.

### What are Generic Fields?

Generic fields in Django are fields that can store any type of data. They are often used in conjunction with the `JSONField` or `TextField` to allow for dynamic data storage. This means you can store different types of data in the same field without needing to create a new model or field type.
