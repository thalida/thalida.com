Key Changes:

- Season flour before breading
- Use pepper spices in seasoning

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. Medium sized, raw peeled shrimp
- Breading:
  - 1 cup All Purpose Flour
  - 2 Eggs
  - 2 cups Panko Bread Crumbs
  - 2 tbs. Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Seasonings:
  - 3 tsp. Garlic Powder
  - Salt
  - 3 tsp. Cayenne (add more to spice taste)
  - 3 tsp. Smoked Paprika
- 3 shallow bowls
- Parchment Paper

## Steps

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside
2. In a shallow bowl mix flour with 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. cayenne, 1 tsp. smoked paprika
3. In another bowl, beat 2 eggs until frothy
4. In the third bowl, add panko, season with remaining garlic powder, cayenne, and smoked paprika. Add salt to taste. I usually do maybe a 1/4 tsp (????)
5. Mix olive oil through out the seasoned panko so itâ€™s fully coated, and no dry pieces remain.
   1. Add more olive oil as needed, there just be just enough olive oil that the panko is coated, but not swimming
6. Bread shrimp (seasoned flour â†’ egg â†’ panko mixture), and place on lined baking sheet
   1. (note: I usually bread w/ chop sticks â€” quick cleanup and no gunked up fork/hands)
7. Preheat oven to 400F
8. Bake for 13-15minutes, until shrimp is golden brown

## Optional: Sauce

- Mix 1 part mayo, 1 part thai sweet chili sauce. Mix in siracha and a squeeze of lime juice to taste
