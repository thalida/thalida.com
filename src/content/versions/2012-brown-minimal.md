## Story

Site Design #8 is the oldest existing version of my site. The first seven versions have been lost to history (and [onepagelove](https://onepagelove.com/thalida)).

## **Designs**

My first design had a very simple dark background

*I was going through a ‚Äúbrown‚Äù phase.*

I was messing around with the idea of having a background image or pattern, and I thought it'd be cool to use a photo of a page in my notebook as the background of the site.

Tested it out on Photoshop, liked the look, and it became part of my final design.
