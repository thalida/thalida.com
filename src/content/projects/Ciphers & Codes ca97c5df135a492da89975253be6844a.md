## Supported Ciphers

### [Affine](https://ciphers.codes/about/affine)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.48.32.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.48.32.png)

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Each letter in the alphabet is mapped to a number, then encrypted/decrypted using a math formula, and finally converted back to a letter.

### [Atbash](https://ciphers.codes/about/atbash)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.50.18.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.50.18.png)

A simple substitution cipher originally created for the Hebrew alphabet. When used with the English alphabet, this cipher reverses the alphabet.

### [Caesar](https://ciphers.codes/about/caesar)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.52.08.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.52.08.png)

A popular substitution cipher, where the alphabet is shifted up or down a specified number of positions.

### [Keyed Substitution](https://ciphers.codes/about/keyed-substitution)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.53.03.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.53.03.png)

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where a keyword placed into beginning of the alphabet, and any duplicated letters are removed.

### [Masonic](https://ciphers.codes/about/masonic)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.53.53.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.53.53.png)

A geometric simple substitution cipher which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid

### [Playfair](https://ciphers.codes/about/playfair)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.54.51.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.54.51.png)

Encrypts pairs of letters, using a 5x5 grid.

### [**Polybius Square**](https://ciphers.codes/about/polybius-square)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.55.43.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.55.43.png)

A cipher where each alphanumeric (a-z, 0-9) character is represented by itâ€™s coordinates in a grid.

### [VigenÃ¨re](https://ciphers.codes/about/vigenere)

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.56.59.png](Ciphers%20&%20Codes%20ca97c5df135a492da89975253be6844a/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.56.59.png)

A simple polyalphabetic substitution cipher which uses a tableau composed of each of the 26 options of theÂ [Caesar Cipher](https://ciphers.codes/about/caesar).

## ðŸŽ¨Â Design

Catalog of various redesigns over time as I got the itch to work on this again.
