### City Generation

#### **BUILDINGS**

- Buildings age based on the age of the file
  - eg. A modern building for a new file
  - eg. A victorian building for a an old file
- Grime / damage on a building based on last modified date
  - the cleaner the building the most recently the file was updated
- The style / type of building is based on the type of file
  - eg. a readme could be a library?

#### **STREETS**

- Each street is the name of a folder
- The width of the street is based on the number of files / directories nested in it
