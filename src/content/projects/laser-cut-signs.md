## Hintze Family

This sign was created as a gift for family. It features a custom design, and a wood laser engraving of a local lake.
I designed the sign, and it was cut and engraved using a laser cutter.


## Craft Room

This sign hanging above the entrance to my craft room. I created the design, and cut it using a laser cutter.

This sign is hanging above the door inside the craft room itself.
It serves as a motivational reminder to try to bring my ideas to life.


## The Coffee Shop

This sign is hanging in a room my partner and I call "The Coffee Shop",
because it has the vibes of a cozy Brooklyn coffee shop. So, I decided to create a sign to memorialize the name.
