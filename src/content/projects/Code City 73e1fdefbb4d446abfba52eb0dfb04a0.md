## âœ…Â Todos

- [ ]  Buy / Create 3D buildings
- [ ]  Update site performance
- [ ]  Take screenshots to update notion build log

## ðŸ§ ðŸŒ©Â Brainstorm

### City Generation

**BUILDINGS**

- Buildings age based on the age of the file
    - eg. A modern building for a new file
    - eg. A victorian building for a an old file
- Grime / damage on a building based on last modified date
    - the cleaner the building the most recently the file was updated
- The style / type of building is based on the type of file
    - eg. a readme could be a library?

**STREETS**

- Each street is the name of a folder
- The width of the street is based on the number of files / directories nested in it
