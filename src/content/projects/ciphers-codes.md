## Supported Ciphers


### Affine

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.48.32.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.48.32.png)

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Each letter in the alphabet is mapped to a number, then encrypted/decrypted using a math formula, and finally converted back to a letter. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/affine)


### Atbash

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.50.18.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.50.18.png)

A simple substitution cipher originally created for the Hebrew alphabet. When used with the English alphabet, this cipher reverses the alphabet. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/atbash)


### Caesar

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.52.08.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.52.08.png)

A popular substitution cipher, where the alphabet is shifted up or down a specified number of positions. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/caesar)


### Keyed Substitution

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.53.03.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.53.03.png)

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where a keyword placed into beginning of the alphabet, and any duplicated letters are removed. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/keyed-substitution)


### Masonic

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.53.53.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.53.53.png)

A geometric simple substitution cipher which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/masonic)


### Playfair

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.54.51.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.54.51.png)

Encrypts pairs of letters, using a 5x5 grid. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/playfair)


### Polybius Square

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.55.43.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.55.43.png)

A cipher where each alphanumeric (a-z, 0-9) character is represented by itâ€™s coordinates in a grid. [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/polybius-square)


### VigenÃ¨re

![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 19.56.59.png](ciphers-codes/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_19.56.59.png)

A simple polyalphabetic substitution cipher which uses a tableau composed of each of the 26 options of theÂ [Caesar Cipher](https://ciphers.codes/about/caesar). [Learn more](https://ciphers.codes/about/vigenere)

Catalog of various redesigns over time as I got the itch to work on this again.
