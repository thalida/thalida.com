After painting my bathroom, I wanted to add some fun art to the walls. I realized the Homer Simpson bushes gif
was perfect for the space, since it'd feel  like Homer was trying to escape being stuck with you in the bathroom.

In order to make the sign, I converted the gif into an svg, and from there I was able to 3D print it.
This was my first time using the multicolor 3D printer, and I was really happy with how it turned out.
