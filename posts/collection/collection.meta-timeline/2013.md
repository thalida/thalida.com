## Story
The first of my live sites, this is the site that's inspired a lot of my future updates and work. I'd wanted to create a site that "connected", and seemed to be catered and created for the viewer. That's a goal that's stuck with me since then.

It's very interesting to me how a lot of the designs in 2013 onward stand up to the test of time, and no-one would really blink if I showed these concepts around as ideas for the next version of this site.

## Concepts

## Designs
Somewhere between these concepts and the final designs below I made a very drastic switch back to something very card based. I probably lost some designs along the way sadly.
