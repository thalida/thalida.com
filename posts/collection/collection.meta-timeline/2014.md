## Story
I had high-hopes of creating a version of my site with detailed case-studies for my various projects. I came up with the mocks shown below, and started coding. Soon I realized it was too soon to create a site of this kinda, I didn't have that many completed projects at the time, and I wanted the site to seem "full".

I abandoned this design and stuck with my current site of the time.
