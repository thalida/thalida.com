## Story
I wanted to create a very simple version of my site, that gave just enough information to let the visitor know what I was all about. My other goal was to create a design with _just_ enough components to test building in various frontend frameworks.

## Design
<img alt="Mock up of the floating card" src="/static/images/posts/meta-history/2015/mock.1.png" class="img--block">

## How it Works
The site was built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), bower, and gulp.
The card color and greeting text is based on the current time of day.
