## Story
After having the floating card design for a while, I wanted to move away from a very simplified site, and create something a bit more complicated. I knew I wanted it to be a one page site, and that I wanted to play around with color again.

## Design

## How it Works
The site was built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

### Time
Based on the current time, the animated gradient as well as the text on the site updates.

### Visits
The salutation is also based on the number of visits, your first visit may say "Welcome", the next "Hello again", and it'll keep changing based on how often you visit.

### Interactive Element
In the past I've played around with interactive elements on my sites, I wanted to do that again here (also as part of the challenge), so I created a simple interactive element that moves as your mouse drags over the image.

It has a subtle paralax effect, with the shapes closer to the front moving faster than the shapes towards the back.
