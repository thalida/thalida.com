## Story
After creating the [first split screen version](/x/meta-timeline/2016-08--2017-03), I wanted to push myself and acutally implement the lowpoly space scene with weather that I'd previously abandoned.

## Design
<img alt="Mock up of space calendar" src="/static/images/posts/meta-history/2017-03--2017-12/mock.2.png" class="img--block">

This is one of those times where the final results almost perfectly match the mockup.

## How it Works
### Time
The sun and moon rotate around the earth based on the current time, yes this is a very Geocentric model of how the solar system works. The color of space changes throughout the day based on the current time.

### Weather
I fetch the weather data using [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/poweredby/), and it's displayed animated floating above the earth.

### Illustrations
I created all of the images used in the scene with [Maxon3D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/), they were previously created for an older version of the site that I abandoned.
