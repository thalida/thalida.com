## Story
My inital concept for [#newwwyear](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/943305744123916288), after building I found myself not liking how it looked and switched it to the [Space Calendar](/x/meta-timeline/2018-01--2018-08).

The idea was that the shapes would rotate based on the time of day, and some of the visible shapes would mimic the current weather.
