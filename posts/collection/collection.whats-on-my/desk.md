My overall look for my home office is one that's very clearly wood, white, copper, and pastel heavy. I wanted something that was clean and minimal, would work well when I'm coding, but would also work well when I'm writing, sketching, and crafting. Everything on my desk, with the exception of my monitor can tuck away at the edges giving me a lot of tablespace if I need it. _Everything_ serves a purpose and has a home.

### Keyboard
This year I finally ventured into the land of mechanical keyboards, and I gotta say I'm sad I waited so long. My current setup is a [Vortex Pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165) 60% Keyboard with blue LEDs. I replaced the standard black case with a [walnut keyboard case](https://www.amazon.com/Wooden-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Compatible/dp/B06ZYMCJBR) (the wrist rest is included).

My last update to my keyboard was changing out my keycaps for ones I saw on Massdrop the [NPKC Gradient Keycaps](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/npkc-gradient-keycap-set) in sunset blue gradient. If you're looking for new keycaps, Massdrop is 100% the place to be, I get emails regularly with new keycap drops that I'm so tempted by.

### Noise Machines & Other Tech
I have two speakers on my desk: a portable bluetooth speaker the [UE BOOM 2](https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/wireless-speakers/boom-2.html), and a [Google Home](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home?hl=en-US) with a [copper base](https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_base?hl=en-US). The only other tech on my desk now is the standard Mac trackpad in white, and a logitech web cam.

## Accessories

### The Everything Holder
I'm using a [file holder](https://www.cb2.com/gilded-file-holder/s117718) from CB2 as my laptop, journals, _and_ letter holder. My journals for the past year and a half have been the ["Strange Ideas & Impure Thoughts"](https://www.mincingmockingbird.com/products/strange-ideas-impure-thoughts-journal) dot grid journals -- if you haven't guess it, these journals were the inspiration for my homepage header.

### Glasses
I love being able to have a place to put my glasses at the end of the day, or when I'm working on something where I don't need 'em. I'm using this [Ceramic Trees Ring Dish](https://www.etsy.com/listing/276271074/ceramic-trees-ring-dish-trees-jewerlry) on Etsy to hold my glasses.

### Random Finds
The light and fan on my desk were both acquired second-hand from co-workers: the light was given to me for free, the fan from a co-worker doing a spring cleaning/moving sale/some-decluttering-event. My pencil holder is a Martinelli's Apple Juice jar from lunch one day, the markers are from [MochiThings](https://shop.mochithings.com/).
