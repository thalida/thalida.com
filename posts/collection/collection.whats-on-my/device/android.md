### Ingredients
Launcher: [Smart Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree)

Icon Packs: [TwoPixel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mowmo.twopixel) and [DarkMatter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mowmo.darkmatter)

Wallpaper: [Walli](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shanga.walli)

### Story
My goal for this theme was to create something colorful and minimal. With that in mind I wanted to find a launcher with a customizable app drawer, and the ability to have different icons on the home and app screens. [Smart Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree) was a perfect fit, the app screen is a swipe away and supports automatically grouping apps by category, as well as creating custom categories like "Favorites".

On the homescreen I'm using the [TwoPixel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mowmo.twopixel) icon pack, 'cause the colors and style went so perfectly with the wallpaper I'd chosen. While in the app drawer the icon pack being used is [DarkMatter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mowmo.darkmatter), I lean towards less-styalized icon packs in my app drawer so that any apps that don't have a custom icon don't look _so_ jarring against the themed apps.
